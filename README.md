# Enhanced Environmental Perceptive Autonomous Agent for Vehicle Automation

Developed an Autonomous Agent to drive a Miniaturized Radio Controlled Car Autonomously. 
* The autonomous agent algorithm runs shape-based classifiers to detect a path and objects present around it
* Learns the nature of the environment based on the objects detected 
* Maneuvers the car on the detected path by avoiding collisions with the objects
